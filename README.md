iClebo Kobuki

In C, a group and I programmed a Nordic nRF52832 IC to interpret different sensing components to operate a circular robot with wheels (similar to Roomba). The iClebo Kobuki had to be able to determine the upward direction, determine if it was at the top, and also descend back down the ramp while avoiding falling off the edge of the ramp.
